Statement :-
Land ownership records are often prone to fraud, disputes, and inefficiencies due to manual or centralized storage. A blockchain-based Land Registry System ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof land registration and ownership transfers. This smart contract automates verification, prevents forgery, and allows only rightful owners to transfer land.


Project Dricription :-
The Land Registry System is a blockchain-powered smart contract that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof land ownership management. It allows users to register land parcels, verify ownership, and transfer property rights securely without intermediaries.
